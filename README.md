# Required module `telebot` 
```commandline
pip install telebot
```
# bot accept too many channel to add channel easy, but channel must have the bot as admin with all premissions
```python
CHANNELS = ['@username1', '@username2']
```
# Bot Idea
```commandline
1. Fighting blackmailers: Convince fraudsters and blackmailers to remove the bot and change some details without their knowledge.
2. Administrative benefit: running channel and change names or bio, also change channel profile photo.
3. Ease of use: adding channels usernames and upgrade bot as Administrator with change channel info, and send message premission.
#There is version post in all channels at same time, very useful soon
